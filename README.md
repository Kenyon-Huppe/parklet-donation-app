# JavaScriptJunkies_Parklet-Donation
Website that serves as a donation site for the Parklet on the Ave in the Seattle U-District.

This webpage houses the code for the donation site for the Parklet on the Ave in the Seattle U-District. This project was created by the JavaScript Junkies team operating out of The University of Washington Tacoma. This site allows for the funding of the renovation of the Parklet on the Ave - upgrading this amenity to the U-District community. 

On this site, users can submit a quote (up to 80 words) after donating $100 or more. This quote will be engraved onto the wooden boards that are layed on the floor of the parklet cementing sponsors into the Parklets history.
